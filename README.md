# SimpleClients

SimpleClients is a collection of simple PHP clients for connecting to various third-party services that are frequently used across multiple projects. It leverages the DevElation library (`bluefission/develation`) to utilize as many custom classes, methods, and patterns from that library as possible. The main purpose of SimpleClients is to provide common connectors to the custom framework Blue Fission Opus (`bluefission/opus`) and the PHP-based Workspace Intelligence Shell Environment (WISE) (`bluefission/wise`) without having repeated code or having to maintain the connectors within the respective projects. However, these connectors are generic enough to be used anywhere.

## Features

SimpleClients currently offers connectors to the following services:

- DuckDuckGo Search
- Google Search
- IP API Geo Location
- Hugging Face
- MurfAI
- OpenAI
- Open Weather
- Trello
- WikiHow
- Wikipedia
- Wiki News

## Installation

To install SimpleClients, use Composer:

```bash
composer require bluefission/simpleclients
```

## Usage

Each service client is implemented as a class under the `BlueFission\SimpleClients` namespace. Below are some examples of how to use these clients.

### Example: WikipediaClient

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use BlueFission\SimpleClients\WikipediaClient;

$wikipedia = new WikipediaClient();
$summary = $wikipedia->getSummary('Artificial Intelligence');

echo $summary;
```

### Example: WikiHowClient

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use BlueFission\SimpleClients\WikiHowClient;

$wikihow = new WikiHowClient();
$results = $wikihow->search('How to make coffee');

print_r($results);
```

### Example: OpenAIClient

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';
